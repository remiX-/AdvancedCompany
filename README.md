## Features

### HUD improvements

#### Held items scrap value

The value of the held scrap is displayed above the item in the inventory. In addition a color palette on the values are used to indicate their worth more generally for quick decision making if you need to leave something behind.

#### Shotgun ammo counter

In addition to the scrap value of the shotgun, the inventory slot will in addition show the amount of ammo present in the shotgun.

### Terminal Commands

#### sell

QualityCompany adds a few commands that let you sell scrap directly from your ship.

You must be landed at The Company Building to use these commands.

These can only be executed whilst landed at the Company Building.

- `sell all` will sell all the scrap on your ship
- `sell quota` will attempt to sell enough scrap to perfectly match the amount needed to fulfill quota
- `sell target` will attempt to sell enough scrap to perfectly match the amount needed to fulfill specified target
- `sell <amount>`, where `amount` is any positive integer, will attempt to sell enough scrap to perfectly match that amount
  - `sell 500` will try to sell scrap equal to 500 scrap value
- `sell <item_name>`, where `item_name` is any portion of an item name to match against. All matching items will be listed
  - `sell whoop` will find all Whoopie Cushions on the ship

**Note:**
These commands use an approximation for finding a perfect match, it may not find one even if one exists (especially early game where you do not have many scrap of low value).\

#### target

- `target <amouunt>` will set target that is displayed on the monitor from the terminal. This target denotes the target amount of credits you want after selling and leaving the company. Additionally a "Needed" field appears on the monitor (second from the left) which will tell you how much you need to sell in order to reach your target. This needed value takes into account approximately how much overtime you will earn and how much current credits you have, so that when you leave the company building you will have the desired amount of credits if you at least meet the "needed" amount.

#### launch

- `launch` optional additional way of landing or launching the ship from the terminal.

#### door

- `door` open or closes the door from the terminal.

#### lights

- `lights` switch the lights on/off from the terminal.

#### tp

- `tp` Teleports the currently viewed player, only works if you have a teleporter.

#### time

Tells the time without having to look at the monitor or go outside.

#### hack

Host only command, that spawns scrap with random values. Meant as a tool for testing (scales from current moon?).

- `hack <amount>` Spawns specified amount of random scrap at your feet.

## Development

You will need:

- Local development setup for [UnityNetcodePatcher by EvaisaDev](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/UnityNetcodePatcher)
- An IDE, Visual Studio / Rider / Visual Studio Code
- Create a copy of `src/CommonBuildProperties.example.proj` in `src/`
  - remove `.example`
  - update placeholder paths & copy commands for your setup

### AdvancedTerminal API

Other mods may use this to easily add custom simple and complex commands to the terminal.

An example plugin will be made for reference use. For now, you can look at `SellCommands` to see how the `sell` commands get setup.
